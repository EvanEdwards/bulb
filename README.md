# Bulb Controller

A command-line interface for controlling Wyze smart color bulbs, created as an experiment in AI-assisted development.

## About

**Author:** Evan Edwards  
**AI Assistant:** Claude (Anthropic)  
**Purpose:** An experiment to see how well an AI can create a CLI interface based on an existing, documented API

This project was developed as a collaborative experiment between human and AI to create a functional command-line tool for controlling Wyze smart bulbs. The AI (Claude) was tasked with creating a complete CLI interface using the existing [wyze-sdk](https://github.com/shauntarves/wyze-sdk) Python library as a foundation.

## Features

- 🎨 **Color Control**: Set bulb colors using hex values or named colors
- 🔆 **Brightness Control**: Adjust brightness from 0-100%
- 📝 **Bulb Management**: Add, remove, and list configured bulbs
- 🔍 **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically find and add all Wyze bulbs in your account
- 🎨 **Custom Colors**: Define and save custom color names
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication**: Encrypted credential storage with token caching
- 📖 **Comprehensive Help**: Built-in manual page and help system
- 🔄 **Smart Caching**: Automatic token management to avoid API rate limits

## Limitations

- **Color Bulbs Only**: Designed specifically for Wyze color light bulbs
- **Hardcoded Python Path**: Uses a hardcoded shebang pointing to the author's virtual environment
- **Unofficial API**: Built on reverse-engineered Wyze API through wyze-sdk

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Wyze account with color bulbs
- Wyze API credentials (Key ID and API Key)

## Installation

### 1. Install wyze-sdk

```bash
pip install wyze-sdk
```

### 2. Get the Script

Download the `bulb` script and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x bulb
```

### 3. Update the Shebang

**Important**: The script has a hardcoded shebang that needs to be updated for your system:

```python
#!/home/evan/.local/pipx/venvs/bulb/venv/bin/python
```

Change this to point to your Python installation with wyze-sdk available.

### 4. Install to PATH (Optional)

```bash
sudo cp bulb /usr/local/bin/
```

## Setup

### 1. Get Wyze API Credentials

Visit the [Wyze Developer Console](https://developer-api-console.wyze.com/#/apikey/view) to create an API key. You'll need:
- API Key ID
- API Key
- Your Wyze account email and password

### 2. Configure Authentication

```bash
bulb --auth
```

This will prompt you for all four required credentials and test the connection.

### 3. Discover Your Bulbs

```bash
# List all bulbs in your account
bulb --list

# Automatically add all discovered bulbs
bulb --addall
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# View help
bulb --help

# Install manual page
bulb --installmanpage

# List all bulbs (configured ones marked with #)
bulb --list

# Add a bulb manually
bulb "Living Room" --add ABCDEF1234567890 WLPA19C

# Remove a bulb
bulb "Living Room" --remove
```

### Controlling Bulbs

```bash
# Set brightness to 40%
bulb "Living Room" 40

# Turn bulb off
bulb "Living Room" 0

# Set bulb to blue with 80% brightness
bulb "Living Room" 0000ff 80

# Set bulb to red with 30% brightness (arguments can be in any order)
bulb "Living Room" 30 FF0000

# View current bulb state
bulb "Living Room" --view
```

### Color Management

```bash
# Add a custom color
bulb --color green 00ff00

# Use custom color
bulb "Living Room" green

# Set custom color with brightness
bulb "Living Room" green 75
```

### Verbose Mode

```bash
# Show detailed debug information
bulb --verbose --list
bulb --verbose "Living Room" red 50
```

## File Locations

The application stores configuration files in `~/.local/share/bulb/`:

- `bulbs.rc` - Bulb definitions (name, MAC address, model)
- `colors.rc` - Custom color definitions  
- `auth.rc` - Authentication credentials (encrypted, mode 600)
- `tokens.rc` - Cached API tokens (encrypted, mode 600)

## Configuration File Formats

### bulbs.rc
Tab-separated format:
```
# Bulb definitions: name	mac	model
Living Room	ABCDEF1234567890	WLPA19C
Kitchen Light	1234567890ABCDEF	WLPA19C
```

### colors.rc  
Space-separated format:
```
# Color definitions
red ff0000
green 00ff00
blue 0000ff
purple 800080
```

## Examples

### Complete Setup Workflow

```bash
# 1. Set up authentication
bulb --auth

# 2. Discover and add all bulbs
bulb --addall

# 3. Add some custom colors
bulb --color sunset ff6b35
bulb --color ocean 006994

# 4. Control your bulbs
bulb "Living Room" sunset 60
bulb "Kitchen" ocean 80
bulb "Bedroom" 0  # Turn off
```

### Daily Usage

```bash
# Morning routine
bulb "Bedroom" white 30
bulb "Kitchen" white 80

# Evening ambiance  
bulb "Living Room" sunset 40
bulb "Bedroom" red 10

# Night time
bulb "Living Room" 0
bulb "Kitchen" 0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Rate Limiting (429 Errors)

The application uses token caching to avoid rate limits. If you see 429 errors:

1. Wait a few minutes before trying again
2. The app will cache tokens after successful authentication
3. Subsequent commands should use cached tokens

### Authentication Issues

```bash
# Re-authenticate if having issues
bulb --auth

# Check verbose output for debugging
bulb --verbose --list
```

### Bulb Not Found

```bash
# List all bulbs to see what's available
bulb --list

# Add missing bulbs automatically
bulb --addall

# Or add manually
bulb "Bulb Name" --add MAC_ADDRESS MODEL
```

## Development Notes

This project represents an interesting experiment in AI-assisted development:

- **Human Role**: Requirements specification, testing, and refinement
- **AI Role**: Code implementation, documentation, and problem-solving
- **Collaboration**: Iterative development with human feedback guiding AI improvements

The AI successfully:
- ✅ Created a functional CLI interface from scratch
- ✅ Implemented token caching to solve rate limiting
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Created proper documentation and help systems
- ✅ Handled edge cases and user experience concerns

## Contributing

Since this is an experimental project with a hardcoded environment path, it's not designed for general distribution. However, the code serves as an interesting example of AI-assisted development and could be adapted for broader use.
